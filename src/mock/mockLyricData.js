Another dream\nThe monster's running wild inside of me\nI'm faded, I'm faded\nSo lost, I'm faded, I'm faded\nSo lost, I'm faded\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese shallow waters never met what I needed\nI'm letting go, a deeper dive\nEternal silence of the sea\nI'm breathing, alive\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhere are you now?\nWhere are you now?\nUnder the bright but faded lights\nYou set my heart on fire\nWhere are you now?\nWhere are you now?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now?\nAtlantis, under the sea, under the sea\nWhere are you now? Another dream\nThe monster's running wild inside of me\nI'm faded, I'm faded\nSo lost, I'm faded, I'm faded\nSo lost, I'm faded"
